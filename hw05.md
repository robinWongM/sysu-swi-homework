## Part 1 - 门电路

1. AND gate:

![AND gate representation](images/homework/05-and-representation.png)

The result is 1 if and only if both A and B are 1, else the result is 0.

2. XOR gate

![XOR gate representation](images/homework/05-xor-representation.png)

The result is 1 if and only if A and B are different, else the result is 0.

3. The following diagram is the one of `(A + B)(B + C)`.

4. The truth table of the circuit:

A  | B   | Result
:--|:----|:-------
0  | 0   | 1
0  | 1   | 1
1  | 0   | 0
1  | 1   | 1

5. 
If the two circuits which receive same pair of A and B produce the same result, then the two circuits are circuit equivalence of each other.

Prove:

![Truth table for (AB)' = A' + B'](images/homework/05-circuit-equivalence.png)

Same pair of A and B produces the same result. So the two formulas are circuit equivalence of each other.

6. In the following diagram, Ax represents the X bit of number A(counted from the right) and Bx does so. FA represents a Full Adder illustrated in the homework requirements.
